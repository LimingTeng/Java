ArrayList inheritance from List
ArrayList is actually a class

ArrayList is a resizeable-array.
It handles it all internally, not only maintains a size of how many elements,
but also the capacity, the amount of memory that is reserved.
And as elements are added to an array list, its capacity grows automatically.
