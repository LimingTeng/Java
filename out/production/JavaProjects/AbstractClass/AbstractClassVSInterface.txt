Differences between abstract class and interface:
Abstract class:
Can have member variables that are inherited, something that can't be done in interface.
Abstract classes can have constructors.
The methods of an abstract class can have any visibility, Private, Protected, etc.
Abstract classes can have defined methods.

Interface:
Can have variables, but they're all public static final variables,
which are gonna be constant values that should never change with a static scope.
They have to be static, because non static variables require an instance,
and you can't instantiate an interface.
Interface also cannot have constructors.
All methods over the interface are automatically public.
