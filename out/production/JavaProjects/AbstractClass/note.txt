Abstraction is when you define the required functionality for something
without actually implementing the data house.
In other words, we're focusing on what needs to be done,
not on the how it's to be done.
So interface is a purely abstract.
And I don't specify any actual aspect of the implementation.
The actual implementation was left to the classes that implement the interface,
and that's why we use the word implements when we're using an interface.
